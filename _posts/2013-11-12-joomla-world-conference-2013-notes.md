Notes from Joomla! World Conference 2013, November 8-10, 2013, Boston, Massachusetts, USA


- The Joomla community is full of amazing people.

- [Kevinjohn Gallagher](https://twitter.com/kevinjohng) is right. To paraphrase, the World Wide Web [has lost its way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN6PIZJVf7w&amp;list=PL0Lg2fzcJu1T4_QwkOu4tbUHs2f6y2NMh) of inclusiveness, and we are to blame for it. We can do better.

- Javier GÃ³mez is probably the happiest guy on Earth, [see for yourself] (https://twitter.com/JAVI_GOMEZ/media).

- Issues should be called "opportunities for awesomeness."

- I'm happy to see Joomla people hugging; we need more of that.

- We need to thank contributors more, communicate better, and not lick cookies.&nbsp;

- GSoC is awesome, and great to see #JRockstars like [Ram Tripathi](https://twitter.com/iamramtripathi) join our community as a result of it.

- I'm inspired to create a multi-instance Vagrant application for Bug Squash events.

- [Ethan Marcote](https://twitter.com/beep) could give a talk about dirt and I'd be inspired. His talk *[The Map and the Territory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45coA4Yq3Lw&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=PL0Lg2fzcJu1T4_QwkOu4tbUHs2f6y2NMh)* is an eye opening smack in the back of the head. He's also a helluva nice guy. Once again, we can do better.

- I am amazed about how many unrelated, unprompted conversations led to the same conclusion. Synchronicity?

- My daughter thinks that Tux is cute.

- My impression of a certain web hosting company hasn't changed, but changed substantially about another. Funny what substance does.

- [Matt Mullenweg](https://twitter.com/photomatt) is very well spoken. My perception of WordPress has changed immensely. [See for yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X1iYm68VdI&amp;list=PL0Lg2fzcJu1T4_QwkOu4tbUHs2f6y2NMh)

- Kudos to Sander Potjer for building on the momentum of the event and immediately engaging with volunteers for the [Joomla Volunteers Portal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIEPnbYMfk&amp;list=PL0Lg2fzcJu1T4_QwkOu4tbUHs2f6y2NMh).

- Everyone can start using [http://issues.joomla.org](http://issues.joomla.org/) now. Please do so, and tweet
