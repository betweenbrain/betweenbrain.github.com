As a new member of the Joomla! project's [Production Leadership Team](http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/leadership-team.html), my head is spinning with ideas and inspiration, especially with just returning from the [Joomla World Conference 2013](http://conference.joomla.org/). Overall, I hope to improve the project and to help Joomla sustain its relevance and longevity. To achieve this, there are a number of areas that I intend to focus on:

- Improve communication: This not only applies outward, but inward as well. Communication is key to any successful relationship. One way that we can improve our communication is to increase our transparency as a team. I plan on seeking as much feedback as possible, when appropriate, from the community when making decisions.

	Internally, we have already begun moving away from tools like Skype that make it difficult for an international team to communicate, and are engaged in ongoing discussions of other ways that we can increase our communication and its effectiveness.

	Within the community, we need to improve our communication channels, not to mention how we communicate. [Hello](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/joomla-dev-general/rqlsqjTQCnU/gfJ7dXcrlpgJ) - one word - is all that needs to be written to prove that we can do better.

- Increase collaboration: I see the PLT's role not as those who write the code, but those who help guide and foster the writing of the code, as well as to help fostering the developer community. One of my goals is to further engage with the developer community, which will benefit everyone involved.

- Advance the codebase: Web services anyone? Let's help get the [Web Services Working Group](http://docs.joomla.org/Web_Services_Working_Group) kicked into high-gear and start [Thinking Outside the Platform](http://magazine.joomla.org/issues/issue-may-2013/item/1303-thinking-outside-the-platform) to get Joomla deeply rooted at the core of the [Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)

- Broaden the appeal of the CMS: As of today, we have one flavor of the CMS. This has served us well enough for a some time, but I feel that we have outgrown it and that it's time to push the boundaries to break out of the box. I firmly believe that Joomla needs to fully adopt and support a distribution model to maximize its flexibility and relevance to a broader audience. Joomla distributions have been for some time, and [are still being discussed](http://magazine.joomla.org/issues/issue-nov-2013/item/1586-distributions-when-one-flavour-is-not-enough), and now even [being planned for](https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here). Being built around a [small common core](https://github.com/joomla-cms/start-here/issues/3), we can achieve this intelligently, and without fracturing our community into a series of forked projects.

	A side benefit of the small common core distribution model is that the separation of extensions from the core, as we know them today, would be a Darwinian extinction, of sorts, for the un-wanted code that nobody uses and cares to maintain. This creates a natural order within the software to help it maintain relevance.


Of course, these are just ideas, and likely just the start. I am only one member of a dynamic team, and only one member of the community. Achieving these goals will take consensus, compromise and collaboration. I can't do it alone, no one person can.
