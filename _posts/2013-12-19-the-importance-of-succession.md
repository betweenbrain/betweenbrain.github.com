I imagine that one of the first things most new leaders think about is what they plan to achieve in their new role. However, I find that all too often overlooked is the dirty work of developing a succession plan. When one can establish a legacy, where others can seamlessly carry on, one has truly achieved greatness.

In open source software, this seems critical to me. The spirit of open source to me is about sharing and empowering others to learn from your work, and for them to even take it further. If you are a leader of an open source software project, be it part of a team, or a sole leader, I would like to think that you want your project to continue after you have left it. Having a well thought out succession plan is critical. Enabling others to be able to step into a leadership role without a steep learning curve, or without them feeling lost, seem like an effort that is worth making.

Think of it this way; how many companies hire a new employee, and just tell them to go to work on the first day without any orientation, training or even a company manual?
