I've been using Wave accounting for just under 1 1/2 years now, for both my personal and business accounting/invoicing, which has spanned a full year of accounting and one full tax season. I cam to Wave from QuickBooks, the Windows application. Before using Wave, I looked at many solutions.

Wave makes it easy to consolidate multiple financial accounts, checking, saving, investment... all in one easy to use dashboard. I do appreciate being able to see everything at one glance.

When getting down to brass tax, Wave makes it fairly painless to categorize transactions in a meaningful way. Adding custom categories, such as web hosting, is simple.

Creating, sending, and receiving payments for invoices is a breeze. If I had any criticism of the invoicing part I on of Wave, it is the character limit that I occasionally run into when creating invoices. Accepting credit card payments, for a fee of $.30 plus 2.9%, makes getting paid easy.

With Wave being a free, (primarily?) advertising funded business, I do have a bit of concern about the financial viability of the company. Having been part of a multimillion dollar start-up, I also intimately understand how even the best funding can't save a company. The product must be solid for it to survive. Sure, the ads can be a little distracting at times, but never enough to annoy

Of course, Wave doesn't lock you in, and makes it easy to export your data in a form easily moved to another system.

Tech support can be a bit slow at times, but I haven't needed them often. When I have, the issue wasn't theirs but the fault of my bank. As it turns out, Wave uses a data provider that establishes the connection with your financial institutions and the data provider sends the data onto Wave. Ironically, this episode also led me to discover that other online accounting services use the same, or similar, data providers. Turns out that the major differences between them is how you interface with your data and manipulate it with in the system.

As a web developer, I find myself noticing things that others may not. The fact that Wave is a JavaScript heavy application drives me nuts! Why I hate it is the fact that some functionality is delayed while scripts are executing. This past weekend, I had the pleasure of sitting down and categorizing over 600 transactions and experiencing this issue every time. Other annoyances courtesy of JavaScript is the altering of native browser functionality. A great example of this is when you scroll to the bottom of the page, click next, and then nothing happens... or at least it seems like nothing happens. What actually happens is that the page content is silently reloading via Ajax and you are not scrolling back to the top of the page, as you would normally expect when navigating to a new page.

The only other issue, if it is one, is that you can't easily merge old and new financial accounts. For example, when my bank changed their website, I ended up needing to reestablish the connection by adding it as a new account. Unfortunately, now they are doubled. Not a deal breaker, but a slight annoyance for someone like me with data OCD.

In the end, I have looked at a number of other accounting systems and i'm still using Wave. That should say enough.
