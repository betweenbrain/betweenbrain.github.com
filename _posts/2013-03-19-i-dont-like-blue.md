Good. Don't make your site look the same as everyone else who forked this thing, that would be super lame.

I encourage you to change things. All layout and styling is in a single file, style.css. If you are familiar with LESS you should make changes instead to /less/style.less and then recompile so that syle.css contains your changes.

##I'm scared of LESS

Not a problem, just edit style.css. You should think about using LESS next time though, it's much faster.
