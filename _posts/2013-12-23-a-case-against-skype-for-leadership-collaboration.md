## Skype is exclusive, whereas email is inclusive
When needing to loop someone into a thread, you must add them to a Skype chat, where they will always be a member of that chat until they leave. Whereas, with email, you can easily loop anyone into, and out of, portions of a thread at any time.

Furthermore, real-time chats, for issues that are not time sensitive emergencies, are exclusive to members of the team that don't happen to be on Skype, and in that chat, at that particular time. Just think of how many times you have logged onto Skype to discover that only hours before a topic near and dear to you was discussed, decisions made, and everyone has since logged off.

##  Email is multi-threaded
How many Skype chats have you participated in that seem to go off in different directions, even at times at the expense of the original topic at hand. Email allows anyone, at any time, to easily start new threads for more focused discussions.

##  Email can be easily automatically archived
With email, you can effectively search all "conversations" and "chats" at once, quickly and easily. Just try that with Skype, especially when going back months or years in time.

##  Realtime conversations are not always desired
Snap judgments and decision making isn't necessarily productive and effective, and sometimes requiring thought and reflection before responding is to everyone's advantage. Email threads are more easily resurrected without interrupting of topics currently being discussed.

While email is not necessarily real-time, it can approach it with potentially only seconds of delay between responses, while maintaining all of the outlined benefits.

## Email is universal
Skype has always had issues on Linux, and recent releases seem to have hindered its functionality on iPhone and Android devices, and likely others. In comparison, email is comparatively universal and very well natively supported by all devices and platforms.

##  Email is a truly distributed technology
Such as the web, email does not rely on a single, closed network / service provider. If one email server goes down, not everyone is locked out of communicating with one another. More importantly, you are in control of how you participate in email, whereas Skype is at the mercy of Microsoft.

## In summary
Using Skype for collaboration and discussion of leadership topics in not an effective method if you wish for a fully inclusive and effective means of communicating with all of your teams and team members. If you are currently using Skype within your leadership circle, consider this a plea to step back and reevaluate its use and potential harm being done.
