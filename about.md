title: About Acorn Holistic
---
Our objective is to offer an effective, bespoke and responsive service to Schools and families and this service has been developed from direct experience of working with families, children and young people both within the voluntary and statutory sector and knowledge gained from relevant professional qualifications and training.

With a background of working with children and adults at risk of, and those actively involved in offending, a key part of my previous roles has been to encourage and support those who I have worked with to develop a positive attitude to education, training and employment. Each individual has to be treated as such, and therefore the skills and interventions needed to work effectively with each child or family has to be reflective of their specific needs and circumstances.
