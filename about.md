Actually, that's not true. Let's move on.

##The real meâ€¦
I'm a geek. On my cards it says 'Designer and Developer' but I'm fine with geek.

Recently, I fell in love with Jekyll, whilst re-building my blog site [Resolutely Me](http://resolutely.me). This is a spin-off from that project, some things I discovered I could do with Jekyll, in code form. If you want to build something fast, bulletproof, device friendly and clean, I think this is a good place to start.

Professionaly, I run my own web shop, [Internet Inspired](http://internet-inspired.com), creating new [Joomla](http://joomla.org)-powered websites for start-ups and enterprise customers. I'm <em>very</em> serious about markup standards and performance and very good at hammering Joomla into shape.

I'm at my most sociable on Twitter as [@nternetinspired](http://twitter.com/nternetinspired), and it's by far the easiest way to get hold of me, so feel free to say hi, or just stalk me. Whatever.
