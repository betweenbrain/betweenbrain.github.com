		<header><h1>What the funk?</h1></header>
		<p>Hello. This is Jekyll Me, a thing made by
			<a href="http://twitter.com/nternetinspired">Seth Warburton</a>, using the awesome
			<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
		<p>The intention is to provide you with a solid basis on which to build your own awesome Jekyll-powered blog running,
			<em>for free</em> on Github. It's the new hotness, dontcha know.</p>
		<p>All the latest buzzwords are built right in; responsive, mobile-first, content first, html5, css3, LESS. I left out all the old boring stuff.</p>
		<h2>Easy, peasy, lemon, squeezy &reg;</h2>
		<p>If you can figure out how to create a
			<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account, have some idea what you are doing with html and css and know all about copying/pasting you should be fine.
		</p>
		<h3>Gimme, gimme, gimmeâ€¦</h3>
		<p>You don't really need to install anything, but for lack of a better word let's call it and install process. It goes like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you don't have one, get a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account.</li>
			<li>Fork this repository:
				<a href="https://github.com/nternetinspired/nternetinspired.github.com/">https://github.com/nternetinspired/nternetinspired.github.com</a>
			</li>
			<li>Click the 'settings' button and rename the repository to <strong>your-github-username</strong>.github.com
			</li>
			<li>Wait a couple of minutes, then visit your-github-username.github.com in your browser. Presto.
		</ol>
		<h2>How do I turn that into <em>my</em> site?</h2>
		<p>I wrote a few things down, so if you want you can go check out
			<a href="/archive.html">the archive</a>. Or just check out the newest articles below.</p>
